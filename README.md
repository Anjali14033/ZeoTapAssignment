### This ZeoTapAssignment project repositories have both the assignment code
  1. Assignment 1: Rule Engine with AST
  2. Assignment 2: Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring with Rollups and Aggregates
### To run/test both the application/assignment please check the "README.MD" file I have added inside both the folder i.e 1. AST 2. WeatherAPP
  Inside both the folder you will see README.MD file in which I have added how to set-up the project dependencies and how to run and test the application.

  ### Note: For assignment 2: Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring with Rollups and Aggregates
  Once you run the application you need to wait for 5 minutes as the interval to fetch the data from weatherAPI is set as 5 minutes. If you want to quickly test the application you can
  reduce the time to 1 minute. So, that after 1 minute the scheduler will call the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/) and then it will show you the data on UI.
